<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Dieter, a passionate new web developer who loves creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites.
My journey into web development started from a curiosity about how things work behind the
screen — and it quickly turned into a real passion for building and solving problems through code.</p>

<p>I’m currently focused on front-end development, learning and working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks.
I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, visually appealing web experiences and I’m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to improve my skills.</p>

<p>Before diving into web development, I worked in customer solutions and IT, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and a keen eye for detail
qualities I now bring into every project I build.</p>

<p>I may be new to the field, but I’m dedicated, curious, and eager to learn from every challenge. Whether it’s building a portfolio site, experimenting with APIs,
or helping a small business go online, I love seeing ideas come to life on the web.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me tinkering with tech, learning something new, or planning my next creative project.</p>
