<h1>The Best Movies According to Dieter</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Wedding Singer</h3>
<p>It’s a feel-good romantic comedy with lots of ’80s nostalgia, catchy music, and a surprisingly sweet story.
Sandler gives a more emotional performance than usual, and his chemistry with Drew Barrymore really sells it.
The humor is lighthearted and goofy but balanced with genuine warmth.</p>
<p>💡 Overall rating: 8/10</p>
<p>It’s not groundbreaking, but it’s the kind of movie that leaves you smiling — perfect for a relaxed night or date movie.</p>

<h3>2 Fast 2 Furious</h3>
<p>This sequel leans heavily into the flashy cars, wild street races, and early-2000s style — lots of neon, NOS, and attitude.
It’s missing Vin Diesel (he sat this one out), but Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson bring solid buddy-cop energy that keeps things fun.
The plot isn’t deep — more “Miami heat and cool cars” than story substance — but it delivers action and nostalgia.</pp>
<p>💡 Overall rating: 6.5/10</p>
<p>If you’re into fast cars, slick visuals, and over-the-top action, it’s an enjoyable ride. Don’t expect realism — just grab some popcorn and enjoy the chaos.</p>

<h3>I Spit on your Grave</h3>
<p>This one is not for the faint-hearted. It’s a brutal revenge-horror film and a sequel (though not a direct continuation) of the 2010 remake.
The movie focuses on extreme violence, assault, and revenge, leaning heavily into shock value.
The lead actress (Jemma Dallender) gives a committed performance, and the cinematography is decent, but the plot mainly exists to set up horrific scenes of torture and payback.
Critics generally saw it as too graphic and exploitative, though some fans of gritty revenge horror consider it raw and unapologetic.</p>
<p>💡 Overall rating: 4/10</p>
<p>It’s disturbing, graphic, and intentionally hard to watch. Only recommended if you’re into revenge horror and can handle extreme content — otherwise,
it’s best skipped.</p>
